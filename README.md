# House-Price-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

In this project, the prices of houses are predicted by using LinearRegression.

The main idea behind this is to plot the existing (year, price) points on the graph and to draw a straight line meeting the points in such a way that the distance is minimum.

The modules used in this project are : 
  
  - pandas (For data extraction and cleaning)
  - matplotlib (For data visualization)
  - sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression (For price prediction)
